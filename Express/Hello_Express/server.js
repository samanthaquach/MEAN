// Load the express module (Where do you think this comes from?)

app.get('/', function (request, response) {

// notice that the function is app.get(...) why do you think the function is called get?
// Tell the express app to listen on port 8000
app.listen(8000, function () {

// this line will almost always be at the end of your server.js file (we only tell the server to listen after we have set up all of our rules)
